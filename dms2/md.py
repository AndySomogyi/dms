Functions for setting up and performing md calculations.

All function arguments which refer to file input may be either a 
string, in which they are interpreted as a file path, or a numpy array, in 
which they are interpreted as data buffers containing the file bytes.

          at least *distance* nm water are between the solute *struct*

          Set *boxtype*  to ``None`` in order to use a box size in the input

          Any of the box types supported by :class:`~gromacs.tools.Editconf`
          (triclinic, cubic, dodecahedron, octahedron). Set the box dimensions
          either with *distance* or the *box* and *angle* keywords.

          If set to ``None`` it will ignore *distance* and use the box
          inside the *struct* file.
      *box*
          List of three box lengths [A,B,C] that are used by :class:`~gromacs.tools.Editconf`
          in combination with *boxtype* (``bt`` in :program:`editconf`) and *angles*.
          Setting *box* overrides *distance*.
      *angles*
          List of three angles (only necessary for triclinic boxes).
      *concentration* : float
          Concentration of the free ions in mol/l. Note that counter
          ions are added in excess of this concentration.
      *cation* and *anion* : string
          Molecule names of the ions. This depends on the chosen force field.
      *water* : string
          Name of the water model; one of "spc", "spce", "tip3p",
          "tip4p". This should be appropriate for the chosen force
          field. If an alternative solvent is required, simply supply the path to a box
          with solvent molecules (used by :func:`~gromacs.genbox`'s  *cs* argument)
          and also supply the molecule name via *solvent_name*.
      *solvent_name*
          Name of the molecules that make up the solvent (as set in the itp/top).
          Typically needs to be changed when using non-standard/non-water solvents.
          ["SOL"]
      *with_membrane* : bool
           ``True``: use special ``vdwradii.dat`` with 0.1 nm-increased radii on
           lipids. Default is ``False``.
      *ndx* : filename
          How to name the index file that is produced by this function.
      *mainselection* : string
          A string that is fed to :class:`~gromacs.tools.Make_ndx` and
          which should select the solute.
      *dirname* : directory name
          Name of the directory in which all files for the solvation stage are stored.
      *includes*
          List of additional directories to add to the mdp include path
      *kwargs*
          Additional arguments are passed on to
          :class:`~gromacs.tools.Editconf` or are interpreted as parameters to be
