"""
A dictionary of pre-made templates. 
 
TODO, this should be cleaned up: if a user specifies a mdp template, then that template
should be stored in the hdf file. The current approach violates the principle that the 
entire config is in the hdf.
    
*dms* comes with a number of templates for run input files
and queuing system scripts. They are provided as a convenience and
examples but **WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE FOR CORRECTNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR
ANY PURPOSE**.

All template filenames are stored in
:data:`dms2.config.templates`. Templates have to be extracted from
the dms2 python egg file because they are used by external
code: find the actual file locations from this variable.

**Gromacs mdp templates**

These are supplied as examples and there is **NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY
PRODUCE SENSIBLE OUTPUT** --- check for yourself!  Note that only
existing parameter names can be modified with
:func:`gromacs.cbook.edit_mdp` at the moment; if in doubt add the
parameter with its gromacs default value (or empty values) and
modify later with :func:`~gromacs.cbook.edit_mdp`.

The safest bet is to use one of the ``mdout.mdp`` files produced by
:func:`gromacs.grompp` as a template as this mdp contains all
parameters that are legal in the current version of Gromacs.

**Queuing system templates**

The queing system scripts are highly specific and you will need to add your
own into :data:`gromacs.config.qscriptdir`.
See :mod:`gromacs.qsub` for the format and how these files are processed.
